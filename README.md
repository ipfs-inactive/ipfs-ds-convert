- [ ] Tests
  - [x] CI (needs https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/4007, https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs/pull/3575)
  - [ ] Coverage > 80% or more
- [ ] Review
- [ ] Standard readme
- [x] Revert on error / from backup
- [x] Cleanup backup subcommand
- [x] Optimize some standard cases
  - [x] Don't copy directories when not needed
  - [ ] Detect renames
    - Not that common
- [x] Report progress
- [ ] Don't depend on go-ipfs

## Install

### Build From Source

These instructions assume that go has been installed as described [here](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs#install-go).

```
$ GO111MODULE=on go get github.com/ipfs/ipfs-ds-convert@latest
```

## Usage

### Convert to Badger Datastore

Apply the Badger Datastore profile:


```
ipfs config profile apply badgerds
```

Then, start the conversion using

```
$ ipfs-ds-convert convert
```

This can take a very long time to complete depending on the size of the datastore. If running this on a headless server it's recommended to use something like `screen` or `tmux` to run this command in a persistent shell.
